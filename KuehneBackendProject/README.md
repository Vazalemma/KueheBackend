So let's start stating the obvious.
I did not present a fully working code.

I started off trying to using Visual Studio Code for the Java project and was wondering how I would integrate an SQL database to it.



I spent hours trying different things, from downloading an SQL extension (which I assumed wouldn't work, I was right) and some other JSQL abbreviation extension.

I then moved on to trying to download Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, but I couldn't figure out how to start a server there either.

I've used XAMPP before for PHP, but I'm not sure that works for Java.



In the end, I decided to go through the tutorials given through the online introduction/email and used JPA/JPQL.

I was confused about the "include .sql file" part if I'm using an in-build database, but I thought if I could get it to work, it would be fine.

I wrestled with it a lot, but once again couldn't quite figure out how to make a comprehensible database that actually works.



Since I'm running out of time, I've decided to leave you with the failed attempts, along with some created theory.

I've also decided to included some extra files to showcase I've actually done Java, JUnit tests and SQL in the past.



Theory:
- quiz.sql  =  The PSQL table creation solution with all necessary data and constraints
- src/quiz/DaoQuestion.java  =  The theoretical solution on how I would solve the functions if I had a working code
- src/Main.java  =  Where I was testing JPQL but inevitably failed


Better representation of my skills:

Java  - https://github.com/Vazalemma/PR2_Projects
SQL   - Other_Examples/sql  =  SQL examples from a large project I did in University
JUnit - Other_Examples/unit_test  =  JUnit test of a stack class. I've also unit tested on other projects, including a web test, but I think this should be enough for now



One of my weirdest weaknesses is being unable to make initial setups and integrations to make everything work.

I've never quite figured out why I've had these troubles, they have persisted all this time. I end up spending 2x more time on setup than actual coding.

Not even bug fixing takes as long. That usually goes by quite fast for me.



I hope that despite the lack of showcase of the skill for this particular assessment test, that I've still managed to showcase some of my abilities.

I've never used Spring Boot before, and due to lack of time, I don't think I'll be able to start on that, but I will try it out using the tutorial while waiting for your response.

I hope I'll be able to get a more thorough learning experience through your internship though!



Thanks for taking the time to read this.
